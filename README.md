LASER SLAM GMAPPING IMPLEMENTATION

Project Overview:
Executed an advanced project on Laser-Based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using GMAPPING within the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework. The project aimed at mapping an environment using laser range finder data, a crucial technique for robotic navigation and understanding environmental layout. 

Key Contributions:
- Data Preparation and Processing: Leveraged Laser SLAM - Bicocca dataset for the project. Utilized Python scripts to convert raw CSV data into ROS-compatible bag files, enabling seamless integration with ROS topics.
- ROS Environment Setup: Installed and configured ROS Noetic on Ubuntu, establishing a robust development environment for the project and integrated various ROS packages, including GMAPPING and map-server, facilitating the SLAM process.
- SLAM Algorithm Implementation: Implemented the SLAM GMAPPING algorithm using laser range finders. Utilized TF (Transform) messages within ROS to manage the coordinate frames of the robot, enhancing the accuracy of localization and mapping.
- Visualization and Analysis: Employed RViz, ROS's 3D visualization tool, for real-time visualization of the mapping process and analyzed the generated maps to assess the effectiveness of SLAM in capturing environmental details.


Impact:
This project demonstrated the potential of laser SLAM GMAPPING in robotic navigation and environment mapping. The successful implementation highlighted the precision of laser range finders in detecting and mapping surroundings, contributing valuable insights into robotics and autonomous systems.
